# Regularized Subset Selection Project

The objective of this project was to simulate regularized (LASSO and Elastic-net) linear and logistic regression models for feature selection in order to
verify results about the accuracy of these feature selection methods, as presented in the following paper:

    Florentina Bunea. 2008. Honest variable selection in linear and logistic regression models
        via l1 and l1 + l2 penalization. Electronic Journal of Statistics, 2:1153â€“1194
    
The code for the project can be found in [Regularized_Subset_Selection.ipynb](Regularized_Subset_Selection.ipynb), and the final report can be viewed in [Regularized_Subset_Selection_Report.pdf](Regularized_Subset_Selection_Report.pdf).
